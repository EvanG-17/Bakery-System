# Bakery-System
Data Structers and Algorithms project 2. Bakery CRUD system.

# Group Project
Made as a group effort with fellow student Evan Hearne from the Cloud and Networds stream.
Done for my second assignment in semester 2.

# The project

This is a project designed to test our ability in JavaFX, linked lists and creating our own data structures from scratch.

I believe we performed well as a team and completed a great project
